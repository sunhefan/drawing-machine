The conceptual basis of my project is cultural diversity. Shapes with different colors that represent people of different cultures. There are two shapes with different proportions will pop up when clicking the mouse at different position of canvas every time. The different colors represent different moods. The different shapes represent different personalities and styles. When different personalities of people come together,   controlling or changing each other cannot maintain a good relationship.
